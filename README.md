## 🚀 Rofi - Application Launcher and More

### Application Launcher and Ags
My Rofi launcher is customized to integrate seamlessly with my overall theme. It offers a clean and responsive interface for launching your favorite applications.

Special thanks to [JaKooLit](https://github.com/JaKooLit) for the inspiration.

### Wallpaper Selector
I created a custom wallpaper selector with Rofi that allows you to easily choose and apply wallpapers from a visual interface.

To use the wallpaper selector:
---
 Key: `Mod+W` (Mod = Super = Windows Key)

 Selected Ramdom
 Selected Multi-workspace
 Selected Effect
 Selected Mpvpaper

Wallpaper:
 ~/Pictures/wallpapers/
Mpvpaper:
~/Pictures/wallpapers/Video/

## 🎨 Wallust - Dynamic Themes

Wallust automatically manages my color schemes based on the current wallpaper, creating a cohesive visual experience across the entire system.

### GTK & Thunar Integration
My setup uses a custom GTK configuration based on the [phocus/gtk](https://github.com/phocus/gtk) project that makes Thunar (and all other GTK applications) automatically adapt to the color scheme generated by Wallust.

#### How it works:
1. Wallust extracts a color palette from the current wallpaper
2. The phocus/gtk theme reads these colors from Wallust's configuration
3. GTK applications like Thunar automatically adapt their appearance to match the system theme

#### Setup:
1. Install the phocus/gtk theme in `.themes/gtk`
2. Configure Wallust to generate color variables in the format expected by phocus
3. Apply a new wallpaper using the Rofi wallpaper selector (Mod+W)
4. Wallust automatically regenerates the theme based on the new wallpaper

This creates a seamless visual experience where your file manager and other GTK applications automatically match your desktop theme.

## 🎮 Gaming with Custom Scripts

I developed a game launching system with preconfigured options for each game. This makes it easy to launch games with different configurations without having to manually specify them each time.

### Features
- Preferred options for each game (resolution, fullscreen, etc.)
- Optimized performance configurations
- Integration with Mangohud for in-game statistics
- Support for launchers (Steam, Lutris, etc.)

    -01-script-Game

![Script Gaming](image/Script_game_edit.png) 

    -02 Create new script game
    -03 Name file the game
    -04 Edit script

Example usage:
Script name: The_Finals
Fill in:
    GAMESCOPE_OPTIONS="False"
    GAME_PERF="True"
    GAME_VRR="True"
    ANIMATION="True"
    MANGOHUD_OPTION="True"
    OPTION_AFTER="-useallavailablecores"
    LANG_KEY="fr"

    # ======= GENERAL SETTINGS =======
    MONITOR="DP-2"
    RESOLUTION="3440x1440"
    REFRESH_RATE="165"
    POSITION="0x0"
    SCALE="1"

    RES_WIDTH=3440
    RES_HEIGHT=1440
    FSR="True"

Run the script: config/hypr/scripts/Gamescope/add_script.sh

or 01-script-Game and Run update script 

Then:

```Steam launch option
        The_Finals %command% # Launches The Finals with optimized settings
```
